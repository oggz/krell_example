# Krell Example

A test of the react example with some extra modifications to compare with shadow-cljs. While shadow was great and worked as advertised, it was larger and more complex. I prefer the simpicity of Krell.

## How to use

1. Open code in emacs and jack in using the "krell" repl option.
2. Run `npx react-native start` to start the metro recompiler.
3. Then run `npx react-native run-android` to run on android.
