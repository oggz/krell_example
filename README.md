# Krell Example

A test of the react example with some extra modifications to compare with shadow-cljs. While shadow was great and worked as advertised, it was larger and more complex. I prefer the simpicity of Krell.

These are all the files and config changes that need to be made for the example to work. Overwrite these files after creating the project as outlined on the krell reagent example tutorial [here](https://github.com/vouch-opensource/krell/wiki/Reagent-Tutorial).

## How to use

1. Open code in emacs and jack in using the "krell" repl option.
2. Run `npx react-native start` to start the metro recompiler.
3. Then run `npx react-native run-android` to run on android.
